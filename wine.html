<h1>How to Get Started with Wine Development</h1>
<small><a href="https://wiki.winehq.org/Git_Wine_Tutorial">source</a></small>

<ol>
    <li>Clone the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine.git">git repository</a> for wine development</li>
    <li>Create a fork
        <ul>
            <li>Use your real name on the WineHQ GitLab repository</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fork the GitLab repository
        <ul>
            <li>I added my public ssh key to my GitLab profile.</li>
            <li>Downloaded my fork of the source tree into a local directory on
                my machine.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>My fork of the source is at <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/jplotz/wine">https://gitlab.winehq.org/jplotz/wine</a></li>
    <li>Main site is at <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/">https://gitlab.winehq.org/</a></li>
</ol>

<h1>Regressions</h1>
<p>Regressions are issues with code that come about as a result of changes.
They are unexpected problems stemming from new updates to the codebase.
</p>
<p>Wine uses Conformance Tests, which can sometimes catch regressions.</p>

<p>Following the compilation steps at the above link produces an error that <code>gcc
    -m32</code> does not work. This error can be fixed by installing <code>gcc-multilib</code> package.</p>
<p>Additionally, two more packages need to be installed to avoid errors. These are <code>libx11-dev:i386</code> and <code>libfreetype6-dev:i386</code> on my system.</p>
<p>The ./configure script continues to give warnings about missing dependencies, but these aren't essential to running the <code>make</code> command. I should probably learn how makefiles and all that work, as I assume the build process is an important part of software development.</p>

<p>I don't quite understand the information related to the wine project and 32-bit vs. 64-bit versions. Whatever I have going on with PlayOnLinux is a 32-bit version, because there is no wineprefix/*/drive_c/windows/syswow64 directory.</p>

<h1>Basic Usage</h1>
<p>Wine can be built and run in the same directory that contains the source code. Wine comes with the <code>wine notepad</code> command to test if the program works.</p>
<p>To run it, point it to a .exe file. It is also possible to use <code>wine start [full-file-path-here]</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
    Wine uses test-driven development to a large extent; we write a test, make sure it passes on Windows, and then get it to pass on Wine by fixing Wine.
</blockquote>
<p>I ought to run winetest.exe or whatever it's called on Windows. I don't understand what the output of conformance tests actually looks like. I also have no idea if Wine aims to support Win10 or only Win7 and below.</p>
