        <h1>Recommendations for Kvass</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>Fermentation Time</dt>
                <dd>While the recipe recommends letting the final mixture sit out for a week,
                    I found that my kvass tasted much better after only 1 or 2 days of fermentation.
                    As soon as it stops bubbling it's good to go.
                </dd>
            <dt>Adding Fruits</dt>
                <dd>Add as much fruit as you wish to kvass. As stated in the recipe, avoid citrus
                    fruits such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and limes.
                </dd>
            <dt>Sugar</dt>
                <dd>Standard table sugar will make decent kvass, but the more natural you can get
                    with your sweetener, in my experience the better the results. Try raw honey and
                    the darkest-colored sugar cane you can get.
                </dd>
            <dt>Black Bread</dt>
                <dd>You don't have to use specifically black bread for kvass, as any bread will work.
                    However, it is strongly recommended to use the blackest bread you can find. I have always
                    made mine with dark rye flour from <a href="https://www.greatrivermilling.com/products/organic-specialty-products/organic-rye-flour/">
                        Great River Organic Milling</a>. See my recipe <a href="black_bread.html">here</a>.
                </dd>
            <dt>Container</dt>
                <dd>The original recipe recommends a glass mason jar. While it has not happened to me yet,
                It is common to hear warnings against sealed containers for fermentation, as they will explode.
                I switched to using plastic 2L juice bottles with the caps partially unscrewed. You could also cover the jar with a towel or use a <a href="https://fermenting.studio/resources/fermentation-airlock-all-you-need-to-know/">carboy and airlock</a>.
                </dd>
            <dt>Preservation</dt>
                <dd>Kvass will start to taste awful after a while, so stick to making small batches that you
                will drink within a week.
